# Exercise 34: Accessing elements of lists

# let's create a list of animals:
animals = ['bear', 'python', 'peacock', 'kangaroo', 'whale', 'platypus']

# accessing the elements:

print animals
print "The animal at 1 is %r" % animals[1]
print "The third animal is %r" % animals[2]
print "The first animal is %r" % animals[0]
print "The animal at 3 is %r" % animals[3]
print "The fifth animal is %r" % animals[4]
print "The animal at 2 is %r" % animals[2]
print "The sixth animal is %r" % animals[5]
print "The animal at 4 is %r"  % animals[4]
