# Rules for if-statements:
#  - Every if statement must have an else
#  - In else-statements that 'should never run', use die() 
#  - Never nest if-statements more than two deep 
#  - Blank lines before and after if-elif-else statements
#  - Move complex boolean calculations outside if-checks


# Rules for loops:
#  - Try and never use while-loops
#  - Use for-loops when there are a fixed or limited number of things to loop over

# Debugging
#  - Use print statements to check what is happening in the code
